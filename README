kfc

kiss for colors, a terminal-emulator color palette setter written in C and designed 
for KISS Linux.


BACKGROUND
----------

This project was inspired by Dylan Arap's POSIX shell script, okpal [0]. This
application has similar functionality to okpal but is designed with execution
speed in mind. Compatibility with the following terminator emulators on KISS 
Linux have been tested at this time:

- simple terminal, st [2] 
- alacritty [3]

Other than a terminal emulator and C compiler (e.g. gcc), the application has no 
other dependencies.

Note: I apologize for the "ugliness" of the code at this time. I hope to address
this in future commits.


INSTALLATION
------------

Building and installing from source:

$ git clone https://github.com/mcpcpc/kfc.git
$ cd kfc/
$ make
$ make install


Installing on KISS Linux:

$ kiss b kfc && kiss i kfc


USAGE
-----

kfc [-s palette|-L|-r] [l|-v|-p]
-s palette  Select a palette
-l          List all palettes
-p          Print current palette
-r          Select a random palette
-L          Set light themes (modifier for -s/-r)
-h          Show this information
-v          Show version information


EXAMPLES
--------

- To apply a color palette automatically to a new terminal window, you can add 
  the following line to one of your system startup files (e.g ~/.profile,
  ~/.ashrc or ~/.bashrc):
  
  $ [ -x "$(command -v kfc)" ] && kfc -s PALETTE
  
  Remember to replace PALETTE in the line above with your preferred color 
  palette.
