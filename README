KISS colors, a terminal-emulator color palette setter written in C and designed 
for KISS Linux.


BACKGROUND
----------

This project was inspired by Dylan Arap's POSIX shell script, okpal [0]. This
application has similar functionality to okpal but is designed with execution
speed in mind. Compatibility with the following terminator emulators on KISS 
Linux have been tested at this time:

- simple terminal, st [2] 

Other than a terminal emulator and C compiler (e.g. gcc), KISS Colors has no other dependencies.

Note: I apologize for the "ugliness" of the code at this time. I hope to address this 
in future commits.
