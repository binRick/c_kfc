KISS colors, a terminal-emulator color palette setter written in C and designed 
for KISS Linux.


BACKGROUND
----------

This project was inspired by Dylan Arap's POSIX shell, okpal [0]d. Compatibility 
with the following terminator emulators on KISS Linux have been tested at this 
time:

- simple terminal, st [2] 

As there are no other depend—încies, other than a C compiler (gcc), this program 
should work on distributions other than KISS Linux as well.

Note: The code is quite "ugly" at this time and will addressed in future 
      iterations.
